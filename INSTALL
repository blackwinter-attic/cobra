Installation instructions for Perl extension COBRA

Actually, if you are going to use the cobra.pl program you don't need to
install anything (apart from dependencies, of course) since COBRA is not
capable of handling such an installation yet. Just unpack the archive - as you
are reading this right now, you most probably already did -, change into the
newly created directory and run "bin/cobra.pl --help" for usage instructions.

However, if you're daring enough, or just for future versions, read on for an
exposition of the installation procedure.

To install this module, just do:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install  (this step may need to be done as the superuser)

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't require
the "./" notation, you can do this:

  perl Build.PL
  Build
  Build test
  Build install

The important thing is that the "Build" script gets executed and that you
pass it the "test", "install", etc. arguments.

If you really want to, you can use a more traditional Makefile.PL:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test
  make install     (this step may need to be done as the superuser)

Substitute "nmake" or "gmake" for "make" if you use some other make-alike
on your platform - 'perl -V:make' can tell you what you should use.

It's recommended to use the Build.PL option. If you use the Makefile.PL
option, you'll actually be using the Build.PL option under the surface
anyway, with a pass-through Makefile.

For more information see the README file and the documentation of the
various packages in this distribution.
