NAME
    COBRA - Classification Of Bibliographic Records, Automatic

VERSION
    This documentation refers to COBRA version 0.0.1

INTRODUCTION
    The Perl extension COBRA is basically a wrapper around AI::Categorizer
    aimed at categorizing bibliographic records, with the intended purpose
    to ease its use and allow for proper integration into a library's
    workflow. It originated from the author's diploma thesis "Automatisches
    Klassifizieren bibliographischer Beschreibungsdaten: Vorgehensweise und
    Ergebnisse" while studying librarianship at the Institute of Information
    Science, University of Applied Sciences Cologne (Germany).

    COBRA has been developed and tested on Linux with Perl 5.8.1. However,
    it *should* run on other platforms just as well. If you encounter any
    problems, platform-related or not, please don't hesitate to drop me a
    line.

INSTALLATION
    Actually, if you are going to use the cobra.pl program you don't need to
    install anything (apart from dependencies, of course) since COBRA is not
    capable of handling such an installation yet. Just unpack the archive - as you
    are reading this right now, you most probably already did -, change into the
    newly created directory and run "bin/cobra.pl --help" for usage instructions.
    
    However, if you're daring enough, or just for future versions, read on for an
    exposition of the installation procedure.
    
    To install this module, just do:
    
      perl Build.PL
      ./Build
      ./Build test
      ./Build install  (this step may need to be done as the superuser)
    
    Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't require
    the "./" notation, you can do this:
    
      perl Build.PL
      Build
      Build test
      Build install
    
    The important thing is that the "Build" script gets executed and that you
    pass it the "test", "install", etc. arguments.
    
    If you really want to, you can use a more traditional Makefile.PL:
    
      perl Makefile.PL
      make test
      make install     (this step may need to be done as the superuser)
    
    Substitute "nmake" or "gmake" for "make" if you use some other make-alike
    on your platform - 'perl -V:make' can tell you what you should use.
    
    It's recommended to use the Build.PL option. If you use the Makefile.PL
    option, you'll actually be using the Build.PL option under the surface
    anyway, with a pass-through Makefile.

DEPENDENCIES
    A list of all the other modules that this module relies upon, including
    any restrictions on versions, and an indication of whether these
    required modules are part of the standard Perl distribution, part of the
    module's distribution, or must be installed separately.

    Some of these may themselves require additional modules. Use the CPAN
    shell (or ppm on Windows) to follow these dependencies automatically.

RECENT CHANGES
    0.0.1  Sun Jun 25 22:33:00 CEST 2006
    
     - Initial release; emerged from "categorizer.pl", written for the collegiate
       project "Automatische Klassifizierung von bibliografischen Referenzdaten" at
       the Institute of Information Science, University of Applied Sciences Cologne
       (Germany). This is a complete rewrite for my diploma thesis, trying to make
       considerable use of Perl Best Practices - thanks Damian ;-)
